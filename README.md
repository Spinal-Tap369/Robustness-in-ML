## Introduction

This repo is part of a research which explores various techniques to improve robustness in machine learning models incorporating the following techniques:
- **Adversarial Training:** Enhancing robustness against adversarial attacks.
- **Bias Mitigation:** Addressing class imbalance in datasets to reduce model bias.
- **Differential Privacy:** Protecting individual data within machine learning models.

## Methodology
- **Adversarial Training:** Implemented using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on the CIFAR-10 dataset. This approach includes generating adversarial examples and retraining the model to handle these examples.
- **Bias Mitigation:** Applied to a credit card fraud detection dataset using oversampling and undersampling techniques to address class imbalance.
- **Differential Privacy:** Implemented using logistic regression models with different privacy parameters to balance privacy and accuracy.
